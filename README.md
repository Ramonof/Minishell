# Minishell
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.

## Description
A school 42 project to create a simple shell.

LIBFT - a C library containing a lot of general purpose functions(like from string.h) the program relies upon.

GNL - a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

PARSER - A parser is divided into two parts: a Lexical Analyzer or Lexer takes the input characters and puts the characters together into words called tokens, and a Parser that processes the tokens according to a grammar and build the command table.

EXECUTOR - The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections.
